# Summary examination of available ICANN-related SSR data

This project aims to produce the following:

* A document listing the ICANN data sets, and some analysis on how to analyze the appropriateness, accuracy, timeliness, usefulness of each of the dataset.  
* A table listing the datasets and the corresponding environmental scan category
* A document that lists the SSAC advice, the relevant datasets needed, what data set is available, and any gaps. 

This page will act as the work-in-progress compilation of the project
deliverables.  It is expected that a Google document will be used for
the final version of the deliverable(s) outlined above.  In fact, the
original ODI data asset inventory PDF will initially be converted to a
Google doc with a column added for the environmental scan category, upon
completion satisfying the second objective above.
